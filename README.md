## Description
This todo list allows you to track your tasks.<br>
You can add a new task by typing it into an input form on the top and hitting "Enter" key or clicking the plus sign.<br>
You can cross out a task simply by clicking on it or completely delete it by clicking on a trash icon, which slides in from the right side, when you hover over an item.<br>
You can not enter an empty string, it requires you to enter at least one symbol.
