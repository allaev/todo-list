## Description
This todo list allows you to track your tasks.<br>
- add a new task by typing it into an input form on the top and hitting "Enter" key or clicking :heavy_plus_sign:<br>
- cross out a task simply by clicking on it 
- or completely delete it :recycle: by clicking on a trash icon, which appears, when you hover over an item<br>
- you can not enter an empty string, it requires you to enter at least one symbol<br>
- every time you refresh the page you get a nice motivational quote. :wink:
